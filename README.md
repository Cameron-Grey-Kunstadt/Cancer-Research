# UNM Cancer-Research

This was a program I built at the University of New Mexico Cancer Research Center. The goal of this code is to accept several MRI images of laboratory mice, and using several industry standard equations, determine the Gadolinium concentration of a section of the mouse, based on the brightness of the pixels. This is a fairly common practice in the fields of biomedical sciences, and can be useful in ensuring that the images of mice are being taken at the ideal time.
